# MicroMatic: AI-Assisted Micro‑SaaS Blueprints

### TL;DR

Building micro‑SaaS apps is slowed by setup work like infra, schema design, auth, and CRUD boilerplate. MicroMatic turns plain‑English app ideas into production‑ready blueprints: Neon‑compatible database schema, suggested API endpoints, auth and RBAC, and optional UI scaffolds. It’s built for solo founders and small teams who need to validate fast with explainable, editable outputs.

---

## Goals

### Business Goals

* Acquire 1,000 free users and 100 paying subscribers within 90 days of launch.

* Achieve CAC payback under 30 days on paid tiers.

* Reach weekly active rate of 35% among registered users.

* Reduce blueprint generation cost per run by 40% by month 3 via caching/optimization.

### User Goals

* Go from idea to runnable scaffold in under 10 minutes.

* Generate an editable schema and endpoint plan that fits their use case.

* Export code and DB scripts that run locally or deploy to Neon in minutes.

* Understand why suggestions were made and how to adapt them (explainability).

### Non-Goals

* Not a full no‑code app builder; we generate starting blueprints, not finished apps.

* Not covering advanced domain logic or bespoke UX polish in v1.

* Not supporting every framework; start with one primary stack plus 1–2 alternates.

## User Stories

Personas: Micro‑SaaS Founder, Indie Developer, Rapid Prototyper, Technical PM.

* Micro‑SaaS Founder

  * As a founder, I want to input a natural‑language description, so that I receive a suggested database schema and boilerplate code for core features.

  * As a founder, I want stack recommendations (framework, auth, hosting), so that I pick a sane, modern default.

  * As a founder, I want cost/time estimates and risks, so that I can decide whether to proceed.

* Indie Developer

  * As a developer, I want to review and make minor edits to the blueprint (table names, field types), so that it aligns with my requirements.

  * As a developer, I want to regenerate specific sections (schema only, API only), so that I can iterate quickly without losing edits.

  * As a developer, I want deployment instructions and a health check, so that I can confirm a successful setup.

* Rapid Prototyper

  * As a rapid prototyper, I want to download boilerplate code and DB scripts, so that I can set up my environment immediately.

  * As a rapid prototyper, I want sample data and smoke tests, so that I can verify functionality quickly.

* Technical PM

  * As a PM, I want to share read‑only blueprint links, so that collaborators can review and comment.

  * As a PM, I want a concise rationale for design choices, so that I can explain trade‑offs to stakeholders.

## User Experience

A streamlined flow from idea input to exportable, deployable scaffold with explainable decisions and safe iteration.

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

* Users land on a focused marketing page that promises “From idea to runnable scaffold in under 10 minutes” with a primary CTA: “Describe your app.”

* On first use, an onboarding modal offers two paths: guided questions (app name, problem, target users, core entities, roles) or a free‑form description. Show domain templates and example prompts.

* Guest mode allows 1 free run without signup. Prompt users to create and verify an account to unlock 3 additional free runs. Account creation also enables save/export and sharing.

**Core Experience**

* Step 1: Submit description

  * UI/UX: Minimal friction; show character count and scope guidance; provide auto‑complete for common entities/roles.

  * Validation: Flag underspecified or unsafe prompts; suggest refinements (e.g., “Add primary entities and permissions”).

  * Feedback: Show progress by phase (Schema → API → Auth → Code → Rationale) with ETA (20–60 seconds). Allow cancel/revise.

* Step 2: Review results summary

  * UI/UX: Tabbed interface: Schema, API, Auth, Code, Rationale. Sticky toolbar with copy/download and “Regenerate section.”

  * Validation: Lint warnings (e.g., missing index on FK), suggest one‑click fixes. Highlight RBAC coverage gaps.

  * Feedback: Inline rationale notes explaining design choices and trade‑offs.

* Step 3: Edit pass

  * Schema Editor: Drag to create relations; rename fields; change data types with safety hints; preview sample records and ER diagram.

  * API Tab: View endpoints, verbs, status codes, paginations, filters; example payloads and error responses; OpenAPI preview.

  * Auth Tab: Toggle providers (email/OAuth), password reset, roles/permissions.

  * Persistence: Auto‑save edits and create a version checkpoint before regeneration.

* Step 4: Export & Deploy

  * Choice: Download Local ZIP or Deploy DB to Neon.

  * Export: ZIP includes app scaffold, env template (.env.example), SQL migrations, seed data, README Quickstart.

  * Deploy: Authenticate to Neon, create database, run migrations, seed; show logs.

  * Health Check: Run script validates env vars, DB connectivity, auth config; shows pass/fail with remediation tips.

* Step 5: Save & Share

  * Save blueprint with name and tags; enable read‑only share link.

  * Collaboration: Comment mode (inline notes on schema/API) for reviewers. Activity log records edits and regenerations.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

* Large Prompts: Split into sections; summarize and confirm scope before generation.

* Conflicting Edits vs. Regeneration: Side‑by‑side diff with merge options; preserve user edits by default.

* Compliance Hints: Detect PII fields; recommend hashing/encryption; add migration notes for data protection.

* Rate Limits & Quotas: Clear usage banners; show countdown to reset; offer upgrade path and one‑click plan change.

* Offline/Failure Modes: Resume incomplete generations; retry Neon deploy with idempotent operations; cache last good artifacts.

**UI/UX Highlights**

* Explainability: Rationale callouts beside schema, indexes, and endpoints.

* Keyboard‑first: Shortcuts for save, diff, regenerate, and navigate tabs; accessible forms with ARIA labels.

* Responsive: Works on 1280px+ optimally; functional on tablets; progressive enhancement for small screens.

* Themes: Dark/light themes; persistent preference.

* Readability: Syntax‑highlighted code sections with copy buttons; zoom/pan ER diagram; high color contrast meeting WCAG AA.

* Safety: Clear confirmations before destructive actions (rollback, overwrite, delete versions).

* Branding: Footer shows “Powered by StackStudio.”

## Narrative

Alex is a solo founder with a niche idea: a lightweight CRM for boutique home contractors. In the past, Alex would burn a weekend wrestling with schemas, auth, and CRUD, only to end up with brittle scaffolding and missing pieces. This time, Alex opens MicroMatic, types a one‑paragraph description, selects “SaaS preset,” and clicks Generate. Within a minute, Alex sees a Neon‑ready schema with contacts, jobs, invoices, and activity logs; REST endpoints with pagination and RBAC; and a Next.js scaffold with login, an Admin area, and a basic dashboard.

A few tweaks in the schema editor rename entities and add a custom job status field with an index. The API tab updates automatically, flagging a missing filter that Alex fixes with one click. Alex deploys the database to Neon, runs the health check, and starts the dev server locally. The app boots, sign‑in works, and sample data appears so the demo feels real.

By Monday, Alex has a live demo for three potential customers and clear next steps. For Realm101, Alex’s success becomes a loop: quick wins drive sharing, more ideas flow into MicroMatic, and paid tiers monetize power users who want richer templates and collaboration—Neon deploy remains available but is not used as a pricing gate. Speed, clarity, and explainability convert dabblers into subscribers, while structured logs and feedback close the quality loop for continuous improvement.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

* AI Orchestration: Prompt construction, tool‑use flows for schema/API/code generation, safety checks, cost/latency controls, caching, summarization, and provider selection/routing (default: Gemini 2.5 Pro) with BYOK key management.

* Code & Template Engine: Deterministic scaffolding with pluggable frameworks; templated file system operations; idempotent generation.

* Schema/DB: SQL generation with constraints, indexes, migrations; migration planner; Neon SDK for database provisioning and seeding.

* Auth/RBAC: Email/password + OAuth, session tokens, password reset flows, roles/permissions scaffolds.

* API Layer: REST by default; OpenAPI spec generation; GraphQL optional in P2.

* Observability: Structured logs, tracing, model/run metadata, error taxonomy, and user feedback capture.

### Integration Points

* Neon for Postgres hosting and provisioning (initial); Supabase under evaluation for future phases.

* Google Gemini 2.5 Pro as the default model; BYOK adapter for Anthropic, OpenAI, and XAI; provider‑agnostic orchestration and fallback.

* GitHub for repo export (P2) and CI templates; Vercel/Render deploy guides.

* OAuth providers (Google/GitHub) via selected auth library.

### Data Storage & Privacy

* Store prompts and outputs with user consent; hash/anonymize sensitive fields and PII detections.

* Secrets handling via environment vault; never store raw provider keys in logs; scoped tokens for Neon.

* Compliance: GDPR/CCPA basics—export/delete account data on request; documented retention and access controls.

### Scalability & Performance

* Queue long generations; stream partial results in UI to reduce perceived latency.

* Cache common templates/snippets; reuse embeddings for similar prompts; deduplicate runs.

* Stateless services horizontally scalable; rate limiting per user/tier; backpressure during spikes.

* Initial capacity target: 1–3 requests/sec sustained with burst handling; autoscale thresholds tuned to costs.

### Potential Challenges

* Hallucinations/inconsistencies between schema and API: mitigate with validators, cross‑checks, and post‑gen linters.

* Cost overruns from long prompts: mitigate with guided inputs, prompt compression, caching, and usage limits.

* Drift between manual edits and regenerated sections: solve with structured diffs, merges, and user‑controlled conflict resolution.

* Vendor dependencies: design abstractions for model/provider swap; graceful degradation paths.
